# I Am Learning Go

## ✨ Overview

I'll be learning Go from scratch using the book Learning Go 2nd Edition.

Chapter by chapter, I'm dedicated to absorbing as much knowledge as I can and recording my study progress.

## 🕯️ Encounter

I first encountered `Go` in around 2021. I somehow ended up to the GitHub repo of 唬爛產生器 (I definitely didn't use it).
The [website](https://howtobullshit.me) is no longer active but [repo](https://github.com/StillFantastic/bullshit) is still accessible.
