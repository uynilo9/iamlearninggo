# Chapter 2

## üß© Recap

In Chapter 1, I learnt about `Go`'s predeclared types and variable declarations. The chapter covered `boolean`, `int`, `int8`, `uint`, `uint16`, `float64`, `byte`, `rune`, `string`, `complex` (I'd barely use it), etc. and explained their zero values and use cases.

I also understood the differences and proper usage of `var`, `:=`, and `const`, as well as the concept of constants and zero values.

## üí≠ Reflection

- Always use `float64`.
- Learnt the flexibility of `:=` declaration but became aware of potential variable shadowing.
- Explicit type conversion prevents confusion from automatic type promotion.
- Avoid using `:=` when initialising a variable to its zero value or assigning an untyped constant or a literal to a variable.
- `Go`'s philosophy of prioritising clarity and readability over brevity
