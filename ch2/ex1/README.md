# Chapter 2 Exercise 1

## ✨ Question

Write a program where you declare an integer variable called `i` with the value `20`. Assign `i` to a floating point variable named `f`. Print out `i` and `f`.

## 💡 Solution

First, I declared a variable `i` with the value `20`.

Since `20` is an integer literal, `i` is given the type `int` by default.
Then, I used `float64()` to convert the value of `i` to a `float64`, assigning `float64(i)` to another variable called `f`.

We always use `float64` in order to avoid potential precision issues.
