# Chapter 1

## üß© Recap

In Chapter 1, I learnt how to install and configure the `Go` development environment and understood the composition of the `Go` toolchain.

By creating a classic `hello world` program, I practised using commands `go fmt` for formatting, `go vet` for checking, `go build` for compiling, and `go run` for running. Besides, `go clean` removes the executable files produced by `go build`.

The chapter also introduced the concept of modules and the role of `go.mod` in managing dependencies.

Finally, I learnt to automate builds using the `makefile` and started working with GoLand IDE.

## üí≠ Reflection

- Understood the importance of `go fmt` and `go vet`.
- Learnt the advantages of automation through the `makefile`.
- Found The Go Playground convenient and powerful for testing.
