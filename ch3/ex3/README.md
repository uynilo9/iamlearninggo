# Chapter 3 Exercise 3

## ‚ú® Question

Write a program that defines a struct called `Employee` with three fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `id`. The first two fields are of type `string` and the last field (`id`) is of type `int`. Create three instances of this struct using whatever values you'd like. Initialize the first one using the struct literal style without keys, the second using the struct literal style with keys, and the third with var declaration. Use dot notation to populate the fields in the third struct. Print out all three structs.

## üí° Solution

By following the rules of `struct` type definition and instance declaration, I easily created the instances in 3 different methods specified in the question.
