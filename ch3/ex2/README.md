# Chapter 3 Exercise 2

## ✨ Question

Write a program that defines a string variable called `message` with the value `"Hi 👩 and 👨"` and prints the 4th rune in it as a character, not a number.

## 💡 Solution

I converted the variable into a rune slice (known as `[]rune`), took the 4th character out, converted it back to a string, and printed it.
