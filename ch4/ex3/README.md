# Chapter 4 Exercise 3

## ‚ú® Question

Start a new program.In `main`, declare an `int` variable called `total`.
Write a `for` loop that uses a variable named `i` to iterate from 0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive).
The body of the `for` loop should be as follows:
```go
total := total + i
fmt.Println(total)
```
After the `for` loop, print out the value of `total`.

What is printed out?

What is the likely bug in this code?

## ‚úèÔ∏è Answer

It printed the numbers from 0 to 9 separately.

The `:=` shadows the `total` on the left hand side as a new variable in the `for` loop scope, since `:=` is able to redeclare variables. [^1]

By the way, this behaviour is extremely important and mentioned in Chapter 2.

Still by the way, GoLand highlights shadowed variables. See the picture below:

## üí° Solution

By replacing `:=` with `=`, I made the program correctly modify the `total` variable declared outside the `for` loop (adding `i` to it) and avoided shadowing.
