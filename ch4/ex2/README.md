# Chapter 4 Exercise 2

## ‚ú® Question

Loop over the slice you created in exercise 1. For each value in the slice, apply the following rules:

- a. If the value is divisible by 2, print "Two!"
- b. If the value is divisible by 3, print "Three!"
- c. If the value is divisible by 2 and 3, print "Six!". Don‚Äôt print anything else.
- d. Otherwise, print "Never mind".

## üí° Solution

Considering the priority of the three numbers, I placed the `case 6:` first, followed by `case 2:`, `case 3:`, and `default:`, which allowed the program to print correctly.
